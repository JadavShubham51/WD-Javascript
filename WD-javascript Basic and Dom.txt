Q-17 :-What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?
A-17 :-
1.The use of innerHTML very slow: The process of using innerHTML is much slower as its contents as slowly built, also already parsed contents and elements are also re-parsed which takes time.
2.Preserves event handlers attached to any DOM elements
3.Content is replaced everywhere: Either you add, append, delete or modify contents on a webpage using innerHTML, all contents is replaced, also all the DOM nodes inside that element are reparsed and recreated.
4.Appending to innerHTML is not supported: Usually, += is used for appending in JavaScript. But on appending to an Html tag using innerHTML, the whole tag is re-parsed.
5.Can break the document: There is no proper validation provided by innerHTML, so any valid HTML code can be used. This may break the document of JavaScript. Even broken HTML can be used, which may lead to unexpected problems.
